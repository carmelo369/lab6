        <h1>Welcome to Mercury</h1>
        <h2>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun, so it has the shortest orbit. 
        In addition, Mercury is a terrestrial planet because it has a composition of rock and metal, 
        this planet has similarities to the Earth's moon. Mercury does not have moons, and during the 
        day the temperature can reach 430 degrees Celcius and drop -180degrees Celsius at night.</h2>
